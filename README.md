# max7219-driver
Serially interfaced 8 digit LED display driver

The implementation of this is with GPIO only, bit banging the chip instead of relying on a serial interface.
It can be easily modified to use a serial interface if required.

## General
This driver is for the max7219 serial display driver.  See datasheet in this repository for more details of how the chip functions.
See this repository for an example of how this is used: https://github.com/stric9r/Line6-FBV3-Clone
